## 1. Calculation Methods

### Life Path Number
**Location:** `src/lib/numerology/calculators.ts:17-32`

**Current Method:**
1. Take date of birth in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
2. Sum all digits in the date
3. Reduce to single digit OR preserve master numbers (11, 22, 33, 44)

**Example:**
```
Input: 1988-05-25
Calculation: 1+9+8+8+0+5+2+5 = 38 → 3+8 = 11 (master, preserved)
Result: 11
```

**Master Number Preservation:**
- 11, 22, 33 are preserved during reduction
- 44 is reduced to 8 (4+4=8)

**❓ Questions for Expert:**
- Is this the correct Pythagorean method?
- Should we use a different method (like reducing YYYY, MM, DD separately first)?
- Is 44 supposed to be a master number or reduced?

---

### Expression Number
**Location:** `src/lib/numerology/calculators.ts:41-46`

**Current Method:**
1. Take full name (all letters, spaces ignored)
2. Convert each letter to number using Pythagorean chart:
   - A,J,S = 1
   - B,K,T = 2
   - C,L,U = 3
   - D,M,V = 4
   - E,N,W = 5
   - F,O,X = 6
   - G,P,Y = 7
   - H,Q,Z = 8
   - I,R = 9
3. Sum all values
4. Reduce to single digit or master number

**Example:**
```
Input: "JOHN DOE"
J=1, O=6, H=8, N=5, D=4, O=6, E=5
Sum: 1+6+8+5+4+6+5 = 35 → 3+5 = 8
Result: 8
```

**❓ Questions for Expert:**
- Is the letter-to-number mapping correct?
- Should middle names be included?
- Should nicknames vs. birth names be handled differently?

---

### Soul Urge Number
**Location:** `src/lib/numerology/calculators.ts:53-64`

**Current Method:**
1. Take only VOWELS from full name
2. Y is treated as vowel in specific positions
3. Convert vowels to numbers using same Pythagorean chart
4. Sum and reduce

**Vowel Rules:**
- A, E, I, O, U are always vowels
- Y is a vowel UNLESS it appears at the beginning of a name or after another vowel

**Example:**
```
Input: "JOHN DOE"
Vowels: O, O, E
Values: 6+6+5 = 17 → 1+7 = 8
Result: 8
```

**❓ Questions for Expert:**
- Is the Y-as-vowel rule correct?
- Should we use different vowel rules?
- Are there exceptions we're missing?

---

### Personality Number
**Location:** `src/lib/numerology/calculators.ts:71-74`

**Current Method:**
1. Take only CONSONANTS from full name
2. Convert to numbers using Pythagorean chart
3. Sum and reduce

**Example:**
```
Input: "JOHN DOE"
Consonants: J, H, N, D
Values: 1+8+5+4 = 18 → 1+8 = 9
Result: 9
```

---

### Maturity Number
**Location:** `src/lib/numerology/calculators.ts:81-84`

**Current Method:**
1. Add Life Path + Expression numbers
2. Reduce to single digit or master number

**Example:**
```
Life Path: 11
Expression: 8
Sum: 11+8 = 19 → 1+9 = 10 → 1+0 = 1
Result: 1
```

**❓ Questions for Expert:**
- Should this be Life Path + Expression, or a different combination?
- Is there a different formula for maturity number?

---

## 2. Current Reading Format

### Reading Structure
**Location:** `src/lib/numerology/composeReading.ts`

**Current Output Includes:**
1. **Frequency Profile** - JSON string of core numbers
2. **Energy Field** - "Dominant: [chakra] · Bridge: [chakra]"
3. **Insight** - Brief interpretation text
4. **Detailed Summary** - Longer interpretation

**Example Output:**
```javascript
{
  input: { fullName: "John Doe", dob: "1990-01-01" },
  numbers: {
    lifePath: { value: 3, isMaster: false },
    expression: { value: 8, isMaster: false },
    soulUrge: { value: 8, isMaster: false },
    personality: { value: 9, isMaster: false },
    maturity: { value: 2, isMaster: false }
  },
  chakras: [...],
  reading: {
    frequencyProfile: "{\"1\":0,\"2\":0,\"3\":1,\"4\":0,\"5\":0,\"6\":0,\"7\":0,\"8\":2,\"9\":1}",
    energyField: "Dominant: solar · Bridge: crown",
    insight: "...",
    detailedSummary: "..."
  }
}
```

**❓ Questions for Expert:**
- Is this the right structure for a reading?
- Should readings include more/less information?
- Is the interpretation text approach correct?

---

### Chakra Mapping
**Location:** `src/lib/numerology/chakraMap.ts:17-56`

**Current Mapping:**
```
1 → Solar Plexus (fire)
2 → Sacral (water)
3 → Throat (ether)
4 → Heart (air)
5 → Throat (ether)
6 → Heart (air)
7 → Third Eye (ether)
8 → Solar Plexus (fire)
9 → Crown (ether)
11 → Third Eye + Heart (air/ether blend)
22 → Root + Crown (earth/ether blend)
33 → Heart + Throat (air/ether blend)
```

**❓ Questions for Expert:**
- Is this numerology-to-chakra mapping accurate?
- Should different numbers map to different chakras?
- Are the elements (fire, water, air, earth, ether) correct?

---

## 3. Compatibility Analysis

### Profile Comparison
**Location:** `src/lib/numerology/compat.ts:130-202`

**Current Method:**
1. Calculate numerology for both people
2. Create "blends" by combining their numbers:
   - **Life Path Blend:** Add life paths, reduce (preserving masters)
   - **Expression Blend:** Simple code like "8 × 8" with interpretation
   - **Soul Urge Blend:** Similar to expression
   - **Personality Blend:** Similar to expression

**Example Life Path Blend:**
```
Person A Life Path: 11
Person B Life Path: 6
Blend: 11+6 = 17 → 1+7 = 8
Output: "11 + 6 = 17 → 8"
Interpretation: "Prosperity through aligned leadership and clear structures."
```

**Synergy Analysis Includes:**
- Life Path Blend with meaning
- Expression Blend with meaning
- Soul Urge Blend with meaning
- Personality Blend with meaning
- Chakra Weave (how chakras interact)
- Prosperity Vector (business/abundance guidance)
- Risk areas (potential conflicts)

**❓ Questions for Expert:**
- Is adding life paths the correct compatibility method?
- Should we use different formulas for different blends?
- Are the interpretations accurate for each blend result?
- Should we calculate a compatibility percentage score?

---

### Action Plan Generation
**Location:** `src/lib/numerology/compat.ts:205-272`

**Current Method:**
1. Analyze the synergy blends
2. Determine focus area:
   - "Legacy Building" (for master numbers)
   - "Prosperity Leadership" (for double 8s)
   - "Creative Expansion" (for 5s)
   - "Emotional Balance" (for harmonious blends)
   - "Alignment Practice" (default)
3. Generate chakra-specific actions
4. Provide a mantra

**Example:**
```javascript
{
  focus: "Prosperity Leadership",
  actions: [
    { chakra: "Solar Plexus", text: "Split decision domains: Vision vs. Operations" },
    { chakra: "Root", text: "Set one measurable prosperity metric every 11 days" },
    { chakra: "Heart", text: "Ground expansion through gratitude practice" }
  ],
  mantra: "Aligned energy builds timeless structures."
}
```

**❓ Questions for Expert:**
- Are these action categories correct?
- Should different number combinations get different guidance?
- Are the chakra-action mappings meaningful?

---

## 4. Questions for Expert Review

### Core Calculation Questions

1. **Master Numbers:**
   - Are 11, 22, 33 the only master numbers?
   - Should 44 be preserved or reduced to 8?
   - When should masters be reduced (if ever)?

2. **Date Calculation:**
   - Current: Sum all digits directly
   - Alternative: Reduce YYYY, MM, DD separately first, then sum?
   - Which method is correct for Pythagorean numerology?

3. **Name Calculation:**
