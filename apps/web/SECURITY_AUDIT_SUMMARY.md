# Security Audit Summary - Vyberology

**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Severity:** Critical vulnerabilities fixed

## Executive Summary

A security audit was performed on the Vyberology codebase, revealing critical API key exposure in the frontend code. All issues have been resolved by moving sensitive API calls to secure Supabase Edge Functions.

## Issues Found

### üî¥ CRITICAL: OpenAI API Key Exposed in Frontend

**Location:** `src/services/reading.ts:24`

**Issue:**
```typescript
// ‚ùå BEFORE (Insecure)
"Authorization": `Bearer ${import.meta.env.VITE_OPENAI_KEY}`
```

The OpenAI API key was being accessed directly from frontend environment variables and included in the browser bundle, making it publicly accessible to anyone who inspects the JavaScript.

**Risk:**
- API key visible in production JavaScript bundle
- Potential for API key theft and unauthorized usage
- Uncontrolled API costs from malicious actors
- Violation of OpenAI's security best practices

### üü° MEDIUM: `.env` File Not Properly Gitignored

**Location:** `.gitignore`

**Issue:** The `.gitignore` file did not explicitly exclude `.env` files, risking accidental commits of sensitive credentials.

## Remediation Actions Taken

### ‚úÖ 1. Created Secure Edge Function

**File:** `supabase/functions/generate-reading/index.ts`

- Moved all OpenAI API logic to server-side Supabase Edge Function
- API key now stored as Supabase secret (not in code)
- Proper error handling and CORS configuration
- Supports all existing functionality (depth modes, Lumen tone)

### ‚úÖ 2. Updated Frontend Code

**File:** `src/services/reading.ts`

```typescript
// ‚úÖ AFTER (Secure)
const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('generate-reading', {
  body: input
});
```

- Removed direct OpenAI API calls from frontend
- Now calls secure Edge Function via Supabase client
- API key never exposed to browser

### ‚úÖ 3. Enhanced `.gitignore`

Added comprehensive environment variable exclusions:
```
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local
.env.development
.env.production
```

### ‚úÖ 4. Created Security Documentation

**Files Created:**
- `SECURITY.md` - Complete security guide with deployment instructions
- `.env.example` - Template for environment variables (no actual secrets)
- `deploy-functions.sh` - Automated deployment script with safety checks
- `SECURITY_AUDIT_SUMMARY.md` - This document

### ‚úÖ 5. Updated Project Documentation

**File:** `CLAUDE.md`

- Added security notes about Edge Functions
- Updated architecture documentation
- Clarified environment variable requirements
- Added deployment instructions

## Verification Steps

To verify the security fixes:

### 1. Check Frontend Bundle (After Build)

```bash
npm run build
grep -r "sk-proj" dist/  # Should return NOTHING
grep -r "OPENAI" dist/assets/*.js  # Should only show variable names, not keys
```

### 2. Verify `.env` is Excluded

```bash
git status  # Should not show .env as untracked
git check-ignore .env  # Should output: .env
```

### 3. Test Edge Function

```bash
curl -X POST https://qptrlxzyindcohsubidl.supabase.co/functions/v1/generate-reading \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"fullName": "Test User", "inputs": []}'
```

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Set Supabase secret: `supabase secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-key`
- [ ] Deploy Edge Functions: `supabase functions deploy` or `./deploy-functions.sh`
- [ ] Verify `.env` is not in git: `git ls-files | grep .env` (should be empty)
- [ ] Test reading generation in production
- [ ] Monitor OpenAI usage for anomalies
- [ ] Rotate OpenAI API key if previously exposed
- [ ] Set up usage alerts in OpenAI dashboard

## Required Supabase Secrets

Set these secrets in your Supabase project:

```bash
# Required for generate-reading Edge Function
supabase secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-actual-key-here
```

## Impact Assessment

### Before Fix
- ‚ùå API key exposed in frontend bundle
- ‚ùå Anyone could extract and use the key
- ‚ùå Uncontrolled API costs possible
- ‚ùå Security violation

### After Fix
- ‚úÖ API key secured on backend
- ‚úÖ No sensitive data in frontend code
- ‚úÖ Proper access control via Supabase
- ‚úÖ Production-ready security posture

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Never use `VITE_` prefix for secrets** - Vite bundles all `VITE_*` variables into frontend code
2. **Always use backend for API calls** - Keep third-party API keys on the server
3. **Regular security audits** - Run bundle analysis before each release
4. **Environment variable reviews** - Audit `.env` files in code reviews
5. **Principle of least privilege** - Only expose what's absolutely necessary to frontend
6. **API key rotation** - Rotate keys quarterly or when exposure is suspected
7. **Monitor usage** - Set up alerts for unusual API consumption patterns

## Additional Security Measures (Recommended)

### Rate Limiting
Consider implementing rate limiting on the `generate-reading` Edge Function to prevent abuse:

```typescript
// Example: Limit to 10 requests per minute per IP
const rateLimiter = new RateLimiter({
  windowMs: 60000,
  maxRequests: 10
});
```

### Input Validation
Add stricter validation for incoming requests to prevent injection attacks.

### Logging & Monitoring
Implement request logging in Edge Function for security auditing:
- Track request origins
- Log failed authentication attempts
- Monitor unusual patterns

## Conclusion

All critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed. The application now follows security best practices for API key management and is ready for production deployment.

**Next Steps:**
1. Deploy Edge Functions with secrets configured
2. Test in production environment
3. If the API key was ever committed to git, rotate it immediately
4. Set up monitoring and alerts
