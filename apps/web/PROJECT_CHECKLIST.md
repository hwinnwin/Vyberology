## 🚧 In Progress

### Supabase RLS (Row Level Security)
- [ ] **Implement Supabase RLS policies for all relevant tables**
  - Current status: Edge Functions handle security, but RLS not yet implemented
  - Need to identify which tables require RLS
  - Need to define access policies
  - **Priority:** Medium - Edge Functions provide security layer

### Testing
- [ ] **Manually test all critical user flows end to end**
  - [ ] Test numerology reading generation
  - [ ] Test compatibility readings
  - [ ] Test Get Vybe features
  - [ ] Test legal pages
  - [ ] Test error scenarios
  - **Status:** Partially done during development

- [ ] **Add unit tests for numerology calculations**
  - Tests folder exists: `src/lib/numerology/__tests__/`
  - Need to add comprehensive test coverage
  - **Priority:** Medium

### Mobile Testing
- [ ] **Test mobile permissions on iOS device**
- [ ] **Test mobile permissions on Android device** (in progress - installing Android Studio)
- [ ] **Add camera/microphone usage descriptions to iOS Info.plist**
- [ ] **Verify Android permissions work on real device**

    - Get Vybe usage
    - Error occurrences
  - **Priority:** Medium

### Documentation
- [x] **Comment complex numerology logic** (partially done)
- [ ] **Document API endpoints** (Supabase Edge Functions)
  - Need API documentation for:
    - generate-reading
    - vybe-reading
    - ocr
    - compare
  - Consider using OpenAPI/Swagger
  - **Priority:** Low-Medium

### Nice-to-haves (Remaining)
- [ ] **User onboarding or tutorial**
