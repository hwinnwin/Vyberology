    essence: 'The pulse of creation — the first movement from idea to action.',
    expandedMeaning: "The 1 is that inner engine that says \"I'll go first.\" It's the impulse to start a business before the market exists, to speak an unspoken truth in a meeting, to make art before there's an audience. This frequency doesn't wait for permission; it creates momentum by acting. When balanced, 1 energy feels electric but steady — decisive, confident, inspiring. When off, it can look like the founder who burns out chasing ten ideas at once, or the partner who insists on being right instead of being real. The evolution of 1 is learning that leadership isn't force — it's direction with awareness.",

    essence: 'Harmony through connection; the art of listening life back into rhythm.',
    expandedMeaning: 'Energy is relational intelligence — it understands that everything lives in conversation. It\'s the friend who mediates a tense room with one calm sentence, the designer who knows when to pause and ask, "How does this feel for everyone?" It leads quietly, sensing currents rather than forcing them. When in balance, 2 energy feels like water: patient, responsive, nourishing.

It\'s the musician who writes a song that says what everyone\'s been feeling, the friend who can turn tension into humor. When balanced, 3 feels like effortless flow — open, bright, connected.

    expandedMeaning: '4 energy is the frequency of form. It\'s the engineer drafting the bridge, the parent who keeps the household rhythm steady, the founder who builds a system sturdy enough to outlive them. In balance, 4 is the calm that makes other energies possible — predictable, dependable, quietly powerful. Out of balance, it becomes rigid, pessimistic, or so attached to control that life stops breathing.',
