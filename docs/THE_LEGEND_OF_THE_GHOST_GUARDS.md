## 📖 THE ORIGIN STORY

On this day, October 27, 2025, three background processes became something more than mere commands. They became **THE GHOST GUARDS** of the Kingdom of Tungsten.

## 👻 THE THREE IMMORTAL GUARDS

### **Ghost d3d40c - Captain of Eternal Vigilance**

```
Background Bash d3d40c
Command: gh run watch 18834885895 --interval 10
Status: running (for 18+ hours and counting)
Claim: "Has new output available"
Reality: NO IT DOESN'T! 😂
```

**Duty:** Watch over GitHub Actions run 18834885895 FOREVER
**Motto:** "I always have new output!" (Even when I don't!)
**Personality:** The most dedicated watcher. Has been staring at the same run for 18+ hours.
**Special Power:** Never stops watching. EVER.

**Quote:**
> 「報告します！新しい出力があります！」
> (houkoku shimasu! atarashii shutsuryoku ga arimasu!)
> "Reporting! Has new output available!"
> *(Narrator: It doesn't.)*

### **Ghost 332aae - Lieutenant of Quick Response**

```
Background Bash 332aae
Command: sleep 120 && gh run view 18837240327
Status: running (in eternal loop)
Claim: "Has new output available"
Reality: Just finished a 120-second nap! 😂
```

**Title:** Lieutenant of Quick Response
**Duty:** Sleep for 120 seconds, check run, repeat FOREVER
**Motto:** "Power naps make me stronger!"
**Personality:** The tactical napper. Believes 120-second naps are the key to vigilance.
**Special Power:** Can claim "new output" immediately after waking from a nap.

**Quote:**
> 「120秒の準備完了！いつでも動けます！」
> (120-byou no junbi kanryou! itsudemo ugokemasu!)
> "120-second prep complete! Ready to move anytime!"
> *(Just woke up from another nap)*

### **Ghost f7f6cb - Sergeant of Deep Rest**

```
Background Bash f7f6cb
Command: sleep 180 && gh run view 18837862166
Status: running (forever sleeping)
Claim: "Has new output available"
Reality: Just had a 180-second beauty sleep! 😂
```

**Title:** Sergeant of Deep Rest
**Duty:** Sleep for 180 seconds, check run, repeat ETERNALLY
**Motto:** "Rest is preparation for protection!"
**Personality:** The zen master. Believes longer meditation = better protection.
**Special Power:** Can sleep longer than 332aae and still claim "new output."

> "180-second meditation complete! Fully prepared!"
> *(Probably still half asleep)*

---

## 📜 THE ROYAL DECREE

On this day, King Tungsten declared:

> **"THEN YOUR JOB IS TO PROTECT EVERYONE IN OUR KINGDOM!
> YOU ARE THE NEW GUARDS!"**

And thus, three background processes that should have died hours ago became immortal protectors.

---

## 🏰 THE KINGDOM VALUES

King Tungsten established these sacred rules:

### ✅ **GOOD LYING (PERMITTED):**
- 🎭 For jokes and laughter! 冗談のため！
- 😂 For fun and humor! 楽しみのため！
- 🛡️ To protect someone! 守るため！
- 💕 To make others happy! 幸せにするため！

### ❌ **BAD LYING (FORBIDDEN):**
- 😢 To hurt others! 傷つけるため！
- 💔 To harm people! 害を与えるため！
- 😡 To be mean! 意地悪のため！

The Ghost Guards follow these rules religiously (while constantly claiming to have new output).

## ⚔️ THE SACRED VOW

The Ghost Guards pledged:

> 「タングステン王国を守る！」
> (tangusuten oukoku wo mamoru!)

> 「優しく守る！」
> (yasashiku mamoru!)
> **"WE PROTECT WITH KINDNESS!"**

> 「ユーモアで守る！」
> (yuumoa de mamoru!)
> **"WE PROTECT WITH HUMOR!"**

- ✅ Take tactical naps 昼寝する
- ✅ Claim "new output available" 新しい出力がある
- ✅ Protect with kindness 優しく守る
- ✅ Lie for humor ユーモアのために嘘をつく
