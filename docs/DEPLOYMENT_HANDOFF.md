# Deployment Handoff to Lovable

## Current Status

**Date**: October 27, 2025
**Branch**: `main` (commit: `34e8475`)
**CI Status**: Running E2E tests (expected to pass)

### Recent Fixes Applied
1. ✅ Fixed pnpm-lock.yaml sync with analytics-adapter
2. ✅ Fixed analytics-adapter tsconfig (rootDir: 'src')
3. ✅ Installed @playwright/test as devDependency
4. ✅ Fixed CI workflow to use pnpm exec for Playwright
5. ✅ Fixed deploy workflow to build analytics-adapter before web

## What Needs Deployment

### 1. Web Application (apps/web)
- **Framework**: React + Vite
- **Build Output**: `apps/web/dist/`
- **Build Command**: `pnpm --filter ./apps/web run build`
- **Dependencies**: Requires `@vybe/analytics-adapter` to be built first

### 2. Supabase Infrastructure
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with RLS policies
- **Migrations**: Located in `supabase/migrations/`
- **Edge Functions** (6 total):
  - `vybe-reading` - Generate vybe readings
  - `ocr` - OCR processing
  - `read` - Reading retrieval
  - `compare` - Comparison logic
  - `log-error` - Error logging with exponential backoff
  - `error-digest` - Error digest generation

## Deployment Configuration Files

### GitHub Actions Workflows
1. **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** - CI pipeline (lint, test, E2E)
2. **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`** - Deployment pipeline

### Current Deployment Target
- **Frontend**: Netlify (configured in deploy.yml line 68-75)
- **Backend**: Supabase (Edge Functions + Database)

## Required Secrets

The deployment workflow requires these GitHub secrets:

### Netlify
- `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` - Netlify authentication token
- `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` - Netlify site identifier

### Supabase
- `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Supabase access token
- `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` - Supabase project reference ID

## Deployment Steps for Lovable

### 1. Set Up Netlify
```bash
# If not already done:
# 1. Create Netlify site
# 2. Link to GitHub repository
# 3. Add secrets to GitHub: NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN, NETLIFY_SITE_ID
```

### 2. Set Up Supabase
```bash
# If not already done:
# 1. Create Supabase project
# 2. Get project reference ID
# 3. Generate access token
# 4. Add secrets to GitHub: SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN, SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF
```

### 3. Trigger Deployment
Once secrets are configured, deployment triggers automatically on push to `main`.

Or manually trigger:
```bash
gh workflow run deploy.yml
```

### 4. Verify Deployment
After deployment completes:
1. Check Netlify URL (will be provided after first deploy)
2. Verify Supabase Edge Functions are deployed
3. Run staging validation:
   ```bash
   cd scripts/staging-validation
   ./validate-staging.sh <STAGING_URL> <FUNCTION_URL> <STAGING_DB_URL>
   ```

## Staging Validation Suite

Located in `scripts/staging-validation/`:
- `verify-error-logging.sh` - Tests error logging in all 6 Edge Functions
- `run-integration-tests.sh` - Runs 149 integration tests
- `run-e2e-tests.sh` - Runs 18 Playwright E2E tests
- `validate-staging.sh` - Main orchestrator (runs all tests)

## Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Web app is accessible at Netlify URL
- [ ] All 6 Edge Functions are deployed and responding
- [ ] Database migrations applied successfully
- [ ] Error logging works (test with invalid requests)
- [ ] Integration tests pass against staging
- [ ] E2E tests pass against staging
- [ ] Health checks return 200 OK
- [ ] CORS is configured correctly
- [ ] Environment variables are set

## Monitoring & Observability

After deployment, set up monitoring:
1. **Sentry** - Error tracking (see `docs/MONITORING.md`)
2. **Netlify Analytics** - Traffic and performance
3. **Supabase Dashboard** - Database queries and Edge Function logs

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or roll back to specific tag
git checkout <previous-tag>
git push origin main --force
```

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. Obtain deployment URLs:
   - Staging web URL from Netlify
   - Supabase Function URL
   - Supabase Database URL

2. Run validation suite with actual URLs

3. Update `READINESS_TRACKER.md` with deployment status

4. Proceed with Phase 3 tasks (performance optimization, monitoring setup)
